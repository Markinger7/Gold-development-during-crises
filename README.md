# Gold-development-during-major-S&P500-crashes
##### by Markus MÃ¼ller
Visualization of the development of the gold price before and during major crashes.

### Motivation
The inspiration for this analysis is this <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/fjvtt5/oc_current_market_sell_off_compared_to_major_ones/'> reddit post</a>, where the current crash is compared to major ones in the past.

Gold is generally known as the safe haven for investors in such crises and is therefore the profiteur of uncertain times. <b>But is this really the case?</b>

### Data
- Gold prices are from `quandle`
- S&P 500 prices from `yahoofinancials`

### Visualization with matplotlib and seaborn
